                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and literally a new language!</p>

                <p>I have learned that most experienced software and web developers embrace the feeling of confusion as the precursor to learning. This is an important distinction to make, confusion is not permanent, just a state you have to get through </p>
 
                <p>Confusion is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to break stuff!</h4>
                <p>This is so important! You WILL break things! This is not only part of the process, but a main part of the process. DON'T PANIC. This is another thing that I see experienced devs fully embrace. Many don't feel they know a program well unless they know how and why it breaks. If you break something accidentally, and find yourself confused, just scroll right to the top of the page. :)</p>
